# List of SQL statements for individualised corrections to data with an audit trail
# Corrections will be applied after creation of the _ix table
# Hence table will already be correctly named and indexed
# Corrections to key fields will need to be handled on a case-by-case basis
# These will modify the import table and run before pulling the data
